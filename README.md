# ML Pipeline for Decision Support & Analytics
I designed and implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to support data-driven decision-making using real-world historical datasets. The system ingests raw data, performs cleaning and preprocessing, applies feature engineering, trains and evaluates machine learning models, and exposes predictions through a production-style REST API.

Recommended runtime: Python `3.11` or `3.12` (Windows + Python `3.14` may appear to freeze while compiling scientific dependencies from source).
